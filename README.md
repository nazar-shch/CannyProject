# Distributed Edge Detection System using MPI

This project implements a distributed system for edge detection in images using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) and the Canny edge detection algorithm. The system is designed to leverage parallel processing capabilities to efficiently handle large images by dividing the workload among multiple processes.
